CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines the structure and content of a web page, a Cascading Style Sheet is a web document that allows you to change the appearance of the HTML.

CSS allows you to change the size, style, font, and color of text; margins and padding; background colors and border styles. It can also be used to position elements on a page (but weâ€™ll leave that for another day).
